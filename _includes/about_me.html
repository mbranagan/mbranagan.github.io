            I have 5 years of experience as a software engineer, working at what started as a small
            company and has grown rapidly during my time there. I have expert knowledge in the 
            financial industry including Electronic Funds Management, lending, and daily institution
            operations. While I'm familiar with all areas of the stack, my experties is the design
            and development of scalable backend services with extensive database administration knowledge.

           I am passionate about programming, puzzles, and problem solving and enjoy using these
           passions to make people's lives easier. I take pleasure in working directly with clients
           to create solutions that can eliminate stress and pressure points in their day to day
           work and life. I've found the best solutions come from brainstorming with a team of 
           subject experts and developer. Collaboration is a key part of any succesful development
           project.
